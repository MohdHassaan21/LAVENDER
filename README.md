OD-GENIE THE AI AGENT TO CRACK ODS
PROJECT TITLE : OD-GENIE 
Think of it as your AI buddy that manages on-duty schedules in a fun, vibey way instead of boring spreadsheets.


DESCRIPTION : 
OD-Genie is a smart, interactive web application that leverages a chatbot-driven interface to simplify and enhance the management of On-Duty (OD) applications for students. Designed with HTML,CSS for blazing-fast performance and TailwindCSS AND JAVASCRIPT for a modern, responsive UI, the system introduces a gamified approach to OD management.

KEY FEATURES :
Chatbot Assistance – Students can interact with an AI-powered chatbot to apply for ODs, check their status, and get instant responses without navigating complex menus.
Scheduled ODs – The platform allows students to schedule ODs in advance, making the process smooth and well-organized.
Leaderboard System – A dynamic leaderboard tracks OD-related activity, encouraging healthy competition among students.
Badges & Rewards – Users earn badges for consistent OD usage, punctuality, or achievements, adding a gamification layer that makes the experience engaging.
Mood-Based Suggestions – If someone’s tired, Genie suggests swaps.
Chatty Interface – Talks like a cool buddy:
     > “Yo Lavanya, you’re on OD tomorrow , don’t ghost me!” > 


Project Goal/Problem statement being addressed : OD-Genie not only automates the OD approval workflow but also motivates students through gamified elements. It transforms what was once a tedious administrative task into an interactive, efficient, and rewarding experience.

HOW MY PROTOTYPE IS SOLVING THE PROBLEM : 
Students often forget to submit On-Duty applications on time, leading to manual tracking issues for teachers and administrators.
>OD-Genie automates the submission and tracking of On-Duty requests using a chatbot interface, making it easier for students to submit requests and for admins to manage them efficiently. The key features that solve the problem :
Automation: Reduces manual work by automatically recording submissions.
Reminders & Notifications: Ensures students don’t forget deadlines.
Easy Tracking: Teachers/admins can instantly see pending and approved requests.
Interactive Chat Interface: Makes submission more engaging and user-friendly.
Describe the benefits of using the prototype:
Saves time for students and staff.
Reduces errors in tracking submissions.
Improves compliance with deadlines.
Makes the process more fun and interactive.

Current Progress Status : We are finished with a chatbot which has saved entries and their od schedules and we are yet to work on real time input entries and their schedules.

The technologies/tools used in the prototype are : chatgpt ,Emmergent , vs-code , vite , markup languages , JavaScript .
